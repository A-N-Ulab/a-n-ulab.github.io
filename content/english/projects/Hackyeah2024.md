### Story
This is our entry for *Open Task: EDUCATION* of HackYeah2024. Our goal was to make a tool to help with learning math. With a little twist, our cute frog Chloe is sometimes passive-aggressive and cursing quite a bit. We all know that if it's fun, it's remembered more easily. Sadly we were doing this project in a team of 3 and later of 2 so we weren't able to add more advanced features... None the less this was an awesome project in our opinion. But doing it in a team of friends was even better
