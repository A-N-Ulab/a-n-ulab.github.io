### Story
This is our entry for *Open Task: EDUCATION* of HackYeah2024. Our goal was to make a tool to help with learning math. With a little twist, our cute frog Chloe is sometimes passive-aggressive and cursing quite a bit. We all know that if it's fun, it's remembered more easily. Sadly we were doing this project in a team of 3 and later of 2 so we weren't able to add more advanced features... None the less this was an awesome project in our opinion. But doing it in a team of friends was even better
=======
### Origin story of out vilan
There were a few categories but only one suited us. Education. We thought that it'll be the best for us bc we are too dumb for gamedev and other categories were just BORING. So education It was. After a lot of thinking (approx. 15min) we came up with a not so great but wonderful idea of a duolingo but math and with a lot of inappropriate words.

#### First issues. Don't ever use python for a web app...
Yep, python and flask. Technically speaking wonderful but in fact it was awful. We spend 5h making a stupid login screen just bc getting data from HTML entries. It was a pain...

#### Team matters
Yes, our team was 3 ppl, for 6 hours... Then there were two of us. And it was kinda difficult to make some app with just the two of us.

### It ended well
After all it ended well, although we didn't win we had a shit ton of fun. And it was awesome to spend some time together coding.
