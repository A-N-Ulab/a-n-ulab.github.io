{{< notice "info" >}}
The second PCB hasn't been fully made so this project log isn't fully completed at this point
{{< /notice >}}  

### Overall idea
This time the idea has changed drastically. First of all, now Otsi is composed of two PCBs.
- The first one being It's main PCB where battery is placed as well as Pico and all different ICs
- The second one being a UI PCB. That means that there are gonna be placed all the buttons, 0.96inch display and a RGB LED
Another change is that right now Otsi is no longer gonna be a handheld but rather a micro laptop of some sort with a lid-mounted main display. Other changes are:
- Different extension ports. This time there are 3x 4pin 3.5mm Audio Jacks that are gonna be connectors for I<sup>2</sup>C extensions
- Improved ergonomics
- different User Input. From now on Otsi is going to be based around a 5 position button with 3 additional ones.
