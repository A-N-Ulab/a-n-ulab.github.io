This project is still in ACTIVE development! And because of studies we don't know when she will be finished
{{< /notice >}}

{{< notice "info" >}}
We are taking a break from Otsi for a few weeks, the past 6 months were filled with pushing her and we need to rest.

### What exactly is Otsi
Otsi is our project that started as a silly submission to [Cyberdeck.cafe's](https://cyberdeck.cafe) cyber-pet contest in fall of 2023 but after winning it we saw her full potential and devoted ourselves to improve every inconvenience and add more!

### Development process
From beginning of 2025 we are constantly working on mk2 of Otsi but not wanting to keep you waiting without any details, here are project logs documenting major milestones as well as our stupid mistakes... Enjoy!
- Otsi.mk2 first revision of a PCB: [click](/projects/otsi.mk2/otsi-log1/)
- Otsi.mk2 second revision of a PCB: [click](/projects/otsi.mk2/otsi-log2/)

### Github repo's
As promised, when finished, we will be posting here *Otsi's hardware* repo (Github repository with documentation on making Otsi.mk2's PCB, soldering everything, etc.) but we don't know if we are gonna release software as open-source. But fear nothing, it will be released as a binary for Raspberry Pi Pico, we just don't know if it's gonna be viable for us to release everything as open-source. We would love to, but we're spending too much time on her and later it might become impossible to keep developing her in our spare time and for free. Hope you will understand us... But for now, enjoy!

###### That's it... for now. Stay tuned for updates!
