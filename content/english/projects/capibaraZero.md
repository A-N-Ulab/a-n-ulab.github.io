CapibaraZero is an awesome alternative for flipperZero made by Andrea Canale and Gabriele Vallosio (you can find the original project under [this link](https://capibarazero.com/)). It's a great device working on a few different boards. What we did here was take the project provided with CapibaraZero and turn it into a PCB.
