##### Who we are
We are a small group of friends that combine our knowledge and skills to build awesome projects for others to use while having a lot of fun.

##### ANUlab's teams
We have divided ANUlab into smaller teams that are meant to do specific things, that's why you are gonna see different teams at the end of each article. Currently there are 2 teams:  
• Totally Not Suspicious Team (TNST for short)- A joke that stuck around, for participating in events such as Hackathons    
• Otsi development team - Their main task is developing Otsi.mk2
